# Trader 

## Introduction

Trader is a mobile application built with Swift and designed for investors to keep track of their stock portfolio. The app has two main pages, the Login Page and the Portfolio Page, each with specific functionalities tailored for the user experience.

## Features

### Login Page

- **Authentication Check**: Validates user's login credentials.
- **User Defaults**: Remembers user's login information for quick and hassle-free access.
  
### Portfolio Page

- **Portfolio Display**: Shows a list of stocks that are in the user's portfolio.
- **Sorting Options**: Users can sort the stocks alphabetically, or based on their value from low to high or high to low.

## How it Works

### User Defaults for Remembering User

Upon successful login, users are given an option to remember their login credentials. This information is stored securely using UserDefaults so the next time the app is launched, the user information is pre-filled for easier access.

### Stock Sorting

In the Portfolio Page, the user has the option to sort the list of stocks in their portfolio. A button allows them to toggle between different sorting options: Alphabetically, Low to High by Value, and High to Low by Value.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run the project in Xcode to see the app in action.
